Removed College basketball code (since it got deleted and none of these jobs use analytic solveR)

Hi there, my name is Erick Atanga.

I believe that what we "know" is only a small fraction of the truth. I want to figure out the whole truth - the big picture.

I like to make discoveries, form new statistics, and generate new insights and ways to think about what we know. This way, people can be more informed, and make better decisions.

Selected Samples
I can make things happen at every stage of the data process - creating and querying data, cleaning and tranforming it, analyzing it and deriving new insights, and presenting findings in a way that clearly displays insgihtful information.

Below is a collection of several Data Analysis and Data Science projects from my professional work, projects, and coursework alike.




Data Science: Predicting Used Car Prices with Python
• Used Machine Learning, data visualization, and algorithmic thinking with the Python programming language to gain insight and display data about factors that influence the price of used cars

• Utilized Python Data science libraries (pandas, seaborn, statsmodels and sklearn) to create a linear regression model in order to preduct the price of a used car.
